If you want to "run" the project enter the following in terminal

1. sudo npm install
2. gulp

Then host it however you wish. I use http-server for personal projects like this.

1. sudo npm install http-server -g
2. sudo http-server -p 90   // Note you can use whatever port you want.

Then go to localhost:90
